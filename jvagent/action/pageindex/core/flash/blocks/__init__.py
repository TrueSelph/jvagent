"""Block clustering. This module walks page lines in reading order, extends nearby compatible
blocks, starts a new block when no neighbor fits, and then splits simple
"heading + body" two-line blocks where the first line is a standalone section
heading. The clustering pass must return blocks, not raw lines. Reading-order assignment
then uses each block's first line to find the column index; doing that on raw
lines would read an unrelated first-span flag.
