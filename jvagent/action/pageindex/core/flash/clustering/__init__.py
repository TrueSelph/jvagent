"""Line clustering pipeline.

The initial pass walks spans in document order and groups them into lines using
an in-line continuation test, while also collapsing overstrike duplicates
(artificial-bold rendering where the same glyph is painted twice). The merge
pass inserts lines into a sorted structure keyed by top-desc reading order,
looks up predecessor/successor neighbors, and either merges the new line into a
neighbor or keeps it separate. Neighbor lookup is inclusive of an exact
reading-order key match, so the successor uses ``bisect_left`` and the
predecessor uses ``bisect_right - 1``.
